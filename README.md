radio song made by Alex Byrne(C15492952) in FL studio.



In this assignment we had to make an interactive user inerface of a spaceship. I feel I followed the requirements well.

In tho top lef, there is a radar. we went over making a radar in a lecture n=but i altered it to suit my project more then the ones from git.

in the top middle, there is a fuel meter. this indicates the fuel remaining in the tank. it displays the % left in text aswell. when fuel is on 0%
the speedometer will not increase as it does when you have fuel.

In the top right there is a speedometer. when you press 'w' the speed increases. when it gets up into the red, warp speed is enabled. this puts the ship into warp speed and also gives
the used a warning that they are in warp speed. when you drop below warp speed, you may be at a different planet then you were at, but u also may be at the same, this depand on how long
you are in warp speed. as i said, the speedometer wont work if fuel is on 0%.

Next on the bottom left, you have the System Vitals. this shows the user the oxygen levels in the ship and also shows the power in each engine. all of this is read in from a TSV file in
the data. it is read in and displayed in the barchart. if you press 't' on the keyboard the chart changes to a trend graph. this means the display of the information is now 
a trend graph instead of a bar chart. if you press 'b' it changes back to a bar chart. you can choose how its displayed.

On the bottom middle is the radio. if the ON/OFF button is clicked by the mouse a song is played and the frequency is displayed on a sound graph to the right of the button. if cicked again
the song will stop and if pressed again, the sonng will restart from the beginning.

The song is my own song, i made espicially for this project. i used FL studio to make this song.

on the right hand side at the bottom is a little planet map. the planet map is a sphere with a texture wrapped around it, when you hover the mouse over and near the planet, the X and Y
co-ordinate is changes based on the mouse. this allows you to look around the globe freely.

Enjoy. Alex Byrne - C15492952.
